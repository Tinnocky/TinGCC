1. Lexing
take the text and parse it into a list of tokens.

keep it in a list: internal name of the token, the characters that make it up (the string) and where is it in the code (line i guess)

2. Parsing
get the list of all tokens and go 1 by 1 to check if the grammer is correct and the code will actually produce something. output errors here

3. code generation
output it to C code
